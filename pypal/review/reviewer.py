"""
This module provides functionality for reviewing Python source code files.

It focuses on function implementations and documentation, using an AI-based
review agent from `pypal.review.agents.openai` to analyze functions in a file.

Classes:
    Reviewer: Handles reviewing Python functions in a file. It reads the file,
    uses the AI agent for review, and writes the output to a new file.

The module works with Python source files, extracting functions and docstrings,
and applies AI-based analysis for insights or suggestions.

Example:
    To use `Reviewer`, initialize with a file path:
    ```python
    from pypal.review import Reviewer

    reviewer = Reviewer("path/to/python_file.py")
    reviewer.review()
    ```

Dependencies:
    - ast: Parses Python code into abstract syntax trees.
    - pypal.logger: Logs details during the review process.
    - pypal.review.agents.openai: Provides the AI-based review agent.
    - pypal.review.formats: Defines review process formats.
    - pypal.utils.file: Manages file operations.
